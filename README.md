Ankou is a parser generator that specializes in automatic syntax error generation via global beam search. See [this post](https://blog.polybdenum.com/2021/02/03/an-experiment-in-automatic-syntax-error-correction.html) for details.

Unfortunately, Ankou is currently "research quality code". This code is presented in the hopes that someone might find it useful or interesting, but it is undocumented and very messy right now.
